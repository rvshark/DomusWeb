<h3>Facebooky theme</h3>
<hr>
<p>Based on the bundled Formal White theme, this is a fixed width theme inspired by Facebook.</p>

<p>The header will show the full site name, and the breadcrumb navigation is duplicated in the page footer. To alter the width to which the main layout is fixed, edit the width value of the table in header.html</p>
